# A/B Test Analysis for Improved Recommender System Implementation in International E-commerce Store

This project involves analyzing an abandoned A/B test for an international online store's improved recommender system. The task requires validating the test methodology, evaluating results, and determining whether the new recommendation system achieves the expected conversion improvements across the purchase funnel.

**Business Context**

Scenario: Inherited incomplete A/B test analysis from departed team members
Company: International e-commerce store
Challenge: Previous analysts left for a watermelon farm in Brazil, leaving only technical specifications and raw test results
Objective: Complete the analysis to determine if the improved recommender system should be implemented

**Analytical Methodology**

1. Study Objectives Definition
Primary Research Questions:

Did the improved recommender system increase conversion rates at each funnel stage?
Was the A/B test conducted properly according to statistical best practices?
What actionable insights can be derived for future recommendation system improvements?

2. Data Exploration & Quality Assessment
Data Validation Tasks:

Data Type Conversion: Ensure appropriate data types for dates, numerical values, and categorical variables
Missing Value Analysis: Identify and characterize missing data patterns
Duplicate Detection: Find and handle duplicate records
Data Integrity Verification: Validate data consistency across datasets

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Funnel Analysis Components:

Conversion Rate Calculation: Measure conversion at each funnel stage for both groups
User Event Distribution: Analyze event frequency per user across test groups
Sample Integrity: Verify no users appear in both control and treatment groups
Temporal Distribution: Examine event distribution across test days
Data Anomaly Detection: Identify peculiarities that could affect test validity

Key EDA Questions:

Is the number of events per user equally distributed between samples?
Are there users present in both test groups (contamination)?
How are events distributed across days?
What data peculiarities need consideration before A/B test evaluation?

4. A/B Test Results Evaluation
Statistical Analysis Framework:

Conversion Rate Comparison: Calculate and compare conversion rates between groups A and B
Statistical Significance Testing: Use Z-tests to evaluate statistical differences between proportions
Effect Size Measurement: Quantify the magnitude of improvement (if any)
Confidence Interval Calculation: Determine precision of estimated differences

Hypothesis Testing:

Null Hypothesis: No difference in conversion rates between control and treatment groups
Alternative Hypothesis: Treatment group shows significantly higher conversion rates
Significance Level: Determine appropriate alpha level for business decision-making

**Expected Deliverables**

1. Data Quality Report

Data Completeness Assessment: Missing value analysis and recommendations
Data Integrity Validation: Duplicate detection and resolution strategies
Data Type Optimization: Recommendations for proper data formatting

2. Funnel Performance Analysis

Stage-by-Stage Conversion Rates: Detailed breakdown of user progression through purchase funnel
Comparative Analysis: Control vs. treatment group performance at each stage
Drop-off Analysis: Identification of major conversion bottlenecks

3. Statistical Test Results

Z-Test Results: Statistical significance of conversion rate differences
Confidence Intervals: Precision estimates for conversion rate improvements
Power Analysis: Assessment of test's ability to detect meaningful differences

4. Business Recommendations

Implementation Decision: Data-driven recommendation on whether to deploy the improved recommender system
Performance Insights: Key learnings about user behavior and recommendation effectiveness
Future Testing Recommendations: Suggestions for subsequent experiments

**Key Performance Metrics**

**Expected Business Impact**

- Revenue Optimization: Quantified improvement in e-commerce conversion rates
- User Experience Enhancement: Data-driven validation of recommendation system effectiveness
- Strategic Decision Support: Evidence-based guidance for product development investment
- Future Experimentation Framework: Methodology template for subsequent A/B tests

**Risk Considerations**

- Test Contamination: Verification that users don't appear in multiple test groups
- External Factors: Assessment of marketing campaigns and seasonal effects during test period
- Sample Size Adequacy: Validation that test has sufficient power to detect meaningful differences
- Temporal Bias: Analysis of day-of-week and time-based effects on results
